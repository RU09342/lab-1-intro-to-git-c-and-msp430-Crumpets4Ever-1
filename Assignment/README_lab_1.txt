README, Lab 1 
Author: Ben Jukus
9/9/2017
Math.h is functioning based on a sample int main made to 
	solely test its individual functionality. All 
	documentation is in math.h in its comments. Math.h
	uses no libraries, modulus as it turns out isn't 
	in an external library.
	Just make sure you put in real numbers and the correct 
	characters for operator. Invalid numbers will throw errors,
	like trying to divide by 0. For modulus use num2 as the dividend
	and num1 as the divisor((num1=5)%(num2=2)=(result=1)).
No dev boards to test any of the example code just yet. 
	They should be arriving soon. Updates to the README 
	might be made a progress is.
